10/22/18 ran make clobber, then renamed all .c files to .cpp
10/22/18 made first pass at converting structs character, npc, pc and dungeon to classes in their prospective .h files

10/22/18 fixed #includes and then corrected errors that popped up throughout converted
10/23/18 fixed comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions
10/23/18 began implementing fog of war. added two maps to dungeon, one tracking if a space is visible and the other tracking known terrain for the pc
