I cannot tell if this satisfies the assignment description
because it will not recognize the cxx11 basic string type on my machine
however, it should work logically because it will read in the monsters as specified
and print them as specified. However, because I cannot test it, I do not know if it works properly.
Dice functionality should be correct though.
