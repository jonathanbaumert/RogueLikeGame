This assignment meets the specification because it implements ranged combat, the poison spell and a few other fun additions.

The command 'a' was added to "aim" at a visible monster and target it.
The 'r' command was added to perform ranged combat on a targeted monster that is visible and alive if the pc has equipped a ranged weapon.
The 'p' command was added to poison the targeted monster and any monsters directly next to it.

The pc has been given a belly, initially set to 100. If the belly reaches 0, the character starves and dies.
The pc's belly can be refilled by eating food. The belly is increased by the weight of the food with a max of 100 and decreases by 1 every third turn.
Food is eaten by expunging it from the game using the 'x' command.

Food objects (apples and bannannas) and ranged objects (crossbow and longbow) have been added to the object_desc.txt file.
Please test with this file.

I also made equipped objects defense stat useful during combat.

I gave the pc mana, which is initially set to 10. Mana increases every other turn by 1. The poison spell requires 5 mana.
