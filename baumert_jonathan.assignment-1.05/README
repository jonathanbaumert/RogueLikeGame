This assignment meets all specifications except the menu scrolling requirement. 
It builds off of the professors code to randomly add stairs and allows the players to use the stairs
and move around the map.
Modifications were made to the rlg327.c file, the render_dungeon function, do_moves function and the function display_monsters was added;
The display monsters function is added to the dungeon.c file and creates a menu of monsters and their locations relative to the pc.
I tryed to get scrolling to work, but am unsure why my code does not work for scrolling.
